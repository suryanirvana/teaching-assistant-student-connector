Teaching Assistant Student Connector (TASC) is a web-based application for students to make appointment with their teaching assistants easily. There are 3 kind of users in this application, student, teaching assistant and admin. Students can see the courses they have enrolled for the semester, also their TAs' schedule. Students can book an appointment with their teaching assistants and set a reminder for it. TAs can see the courses that they are responsible for and can add their schedule in the calendar. TAs can reject or accept students' appointment and set notifications for it. Both students and TAs can set multiple reminders. Admins can oversee user activities in TASC app.
